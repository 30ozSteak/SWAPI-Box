## Project Reflection

This project was fun and challenging. It was our first time implementing React Router and using nested API calls to fetch data. The most challenging part of this project was rendering information from multiple API calls onto a single card; we refactored this function more than once. Certain functionalities in this project turned out to be more difficult and time consuming than we originally had thought. Overall, it was a very humbling learning experience. We both feel more confident with our React abilities and can't wait to continue to make fun applications.
