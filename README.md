## Project Reflection

## Laura
This project was fun and challenging. It was our first time implementing React Router and using nested API calls to fetch data. The most challenging part of this project was rendering information from multiple API calls onto a single card; we refactored this function more than once. Certain functionalities in this project turned out to be more difficult and time consuming than we originally had thought. Overall, it was a very humbling learning experience. We both feel more confident with our React abilities and can't wait to continue to make fun applications.

I have so much fun with parts of react, and struggle so hard with others. This project was no different, but it forced me to learn better practices. I knew, coming into this project, that we'd have to utilize React Router for rendering different routes on click. Thankfully, I had previous experience using Router and knew that this was going to be a major part of the project, so we didn't bother with conditional rendering of any of the routes, and thus, didn't have to refactor large chunks of code once router came into play. Only took a single evening to get all the routes working properly. Getting images mapped to the correct cards from a JSON object was also one of my bigger wins for the project.
The bottom menu button was inspired by a tutorial I watched that utilized custom checkboxes, a CSS only button that responded and expanded to show additional menu options on click. I repurposed it into a react component, and now I have a really rad button that can be carried from project to project. I plan on refactoring this to a true/false boolean component eventually, because it's not entirely reusable at the moment and relies on class names.
overall, lot's of fun. Got to flex some design skills and make a really great looking app.
